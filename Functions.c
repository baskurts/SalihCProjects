// this function uses parameters, all having the char * type
// strings don't exist as a type in C like they do in Java and Python.
// in C strings are treated like an array of characters and are
// referred to as the char * type.
// when you have a * in a parameter (or variable), it means the parameter 
// (or variable) is a pointer.
// pointers refer to memory locations instead of holding values.
// char * means the parameters refer to a memory location that stores 
// a array of characters.
// this is how C deals with strings.
// you could also have int *, or float *, or double * types.
